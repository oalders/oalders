# Olaf Alders

I build developer communities through open source.

I'm the founder of [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org), where I've spent over a decade sustaining a global developer community and creating tooling used by thousands of developers daily. I maintain foundational Perl libraries including [libwww-perl](https://metacpan.org/dist/libwww-perl) and [URI](https://metacpan.org/dist/URI), and I'm the author of [perlimports](https://github.com/perl-doc-cats/perlimports).

Currently raising funds for [The Perl and Raku Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/), co-hosting [The Underbar](https://theunderbar.net/) podcast, and editing [perl.com](https://perl.com) and [The Perl Advent Calendar](https://perladvent.org/).
